# The-Forgotten-Panels-of-An-Artist
A Comic About Procrastination Of The Artists As They Do Some Designs But Don't Finish it.

### Project Description
Our Webpage comic strip seeks to bring life to a forgotten artist's work. As many artists, creators and developers often have many forgotten works that usually start with enthusiasm and passion but end up gathering virtual dust within a folder. Our team imagined comic characters in a forgotten webpage come to life and escape the frame they are frozen within. We wanted this comic to be a gentle and subtle reminder to our audience to look back at their own forgotten projects and maybe give them another shot!

The comic represents the story of two comic characters that start interacting together and decide to break free from the stagnant state they were left in. Inspired by shows like Rick and Morty and Archer, we sought to create a Meta Story that steers away from classical storytelling techniques mostly used in conventional comic strips. With this meta-story we tried to create a unique and fun experience for the audience unlike ordinary storytelling.

### During The Process of Implementing The Project
- The comic was designed using an Ipad and then exported to photoshop software to add more details such as background colors and the text.
- The file was then exported as an SVG file to be used for the Web-page.
- In order to edit and make the animation interactive, we used html,css and Java-script in order to enlarge the comic panels on hover and include sound on click.
- We used Bootstrap to make the website responsive and get use of its already existing tools.
- This was an enjoyable and enriching process as it opened our eyes to the potential of SVG files and how they can be included in Web-pages.
